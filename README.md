# NETS150-Final-Project

Our project is named Graph Algorithm Visualizer. In this project, we create a dynamic web application that 
is locally hosted and run on a server created using Apache Tomcat. With this project, we use a JSP file
that allows for us to insert java code into the html file for the web application. With this, we create an
interface for a user to select a certain graph algorithm, and execute it on a graph with 12 vertices and 
randomly generated directed edges. Then, we execute either 
BFS, DFS, or Dijkstra on a weighted, directed graph in a JPanel using the Java Swing package. In the execution, 
the graph is drawn as black and as a node is considered it turns red. Additionally, we color edges as red as we 
execute the graph traversal, which in DFS occurs one edge at a time and in BFS occurs layer by layer.
